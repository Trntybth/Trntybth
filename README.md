👋 Hi, I'm Trinity Booth!
I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Salford.

👀 I am passionate about software development, with a particular interest in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices.

💻 Experienced with frameworks like Spring Boot and Retrofit, and actively working on Android app development using Java and XML layouts.

🔧 Comfortable working with databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, H2), and implementing CRUD operations within backend systems.

🚀 Excited to collaborate on projects involving backend development, mobile apps, or full-stack applications.
